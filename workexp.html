  <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>

    <li><strong>Locum Pharmacist (16/4/19- present):</strong></li>
    My role entails contracted work at various pharmacies throughout the UK. My roles and responsibilities for this role include ensuring any items leaving the pharmacy are clinically appropriate and the smooth operation of the whole pharmacy at the time I am present. I ensure all work is completed and the pharmacy is left in a tidy manor. I maintain my professionalism at all times.

    <li><strong>Pharmacy manager Well pharmacy Blurton (1/7/17-16/4/19):</strong></li>
    I was recruited for my current position as pharmacy manager via linkedin. The store had no stable manager for a period of more than two years and the area manager was looking for a candidate that would be able to organize the store. After beginning my role, I proceeded to organize all aspects of the pharmacy including trays, staff roles, rotas and the day to day to operation. Following cuts in staffing hours I still managed to successfully lead the team to a positive revenue forecast and we have progressed up our area league table from 9th to 2nd overall in our region.

    <li><strong>Pharmacy manager Millers pharmacy Blythe bridge (1/9/16-1/4/17):</strong></li>
    Having shown promise in my short period of time at Madeley, I was subsequently moved to one of the busier branches within the company. Here I organized the pharmacy to improve work flow, helped guide and positioned staff in the appropriate roles and conducted several more changes to help run the pharmacy more efficiently and effectively. We currently process approximately 12,000 items within our 48.5hr weekly opening times. This requires me to provide clear direction and maintain clockwork precision in all procedures. I have had to deal with several crisis situations and staff conflicts which I believe has provided me with invaluable experience and reassurance in my own capabilities. I have also been conducting services including flu jabs and MUR’s whilst helping build patient relationships.

I managed to boost monthly prescription figures and hit my targets for services including MUR’s and NMS’s. Furthermore, I implemented a new system for patient dosage boxes and updated the OCD (order collect delivery) system; as well as conducting further efficiency measures. I was also organizing the pharmacies transfer to EPS.
